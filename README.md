# What is this :smile:

The project receives two lidar called */pandar_points* and */cloud_node_left/rslidar_points_left* based on ROS, and displays them via Pangolin.
You can translate or rotate the latter lidar through Pangolin ui.

All in all, that is a good way to know Pangolin, since there are little docs about Pangolin. The project refers to [HTLife](https://github.com/HTLife/PangoCloud.git)
